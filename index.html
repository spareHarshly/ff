By the time you're reading this, Iâ€™m already gone, so I just want to say that this game, Super Sus, is the best game Iâ€™ve ever played. Itâ€™s where I met the best people Iâ€™ve known so far, like Afreen, Shayanti, Shivu, Pagli(real name nhi luga), Rajat, and many others. Iâ€™ve never met friends like you in school, college, or anywhere else. In this game, the bonds we formed were genuine, and the fun we had was on the same level. Spending time with you all has been the best time Iâ€™ve had since school. I got so used to talking to you guys that when I didnâ€™t talk to you for a few days, my days felt incomplete, and nothing seemed to interest me.

I remember the first person I met in this game â€” yes, itâ€™s you, Afreen, my bestest friend, my first bestest friend. I remember when we first met, you were joking around with me, proposing to me, doing all these crazy things that seemed so weird to me. I thought, "Is this girl crazy, or has she been drinking or something?" But later I understood, and thatâ€™s how we started playing the game together, having fun. Sometimes solo, sometimes together, but it was always fun. Some people had problems with us, but our friendship never suffered. We created so many great memories. Yes, there were some bad memories too, where we fought a lot, but even those fights were fun because, as they say, the more you fight, the stronger the bond becomes. And where there is love, there will always be fights. Iâ€™m sorry if I did something wrong, but you are my best person, and for you, I would give anything without a second thought. I hope youâ€™ll keep those gifts safe in your memory for me.

Pagli, I know we didnâ€™t spend much time together, but weâ€™ve been friends for a year now, and for the past few months, weâ€™ve had so much fun and crazy moments. Iâ€™ll never forget the time we pretended to be in a relationship â€” that was one of the best memories with you, and you know that. Also, I know you regret commenting that day because after that, I annoyed you a lot, and yes, I lost that challenge. Seriously, I lost as a guy in that challenge, but it's okay, losing and winning are part of the game. It was still fun doing all that with you, playing together, and teaching you BGMI, which was tough for you, but you were learning. Now Iâ€™m not there, so take care of yourself. Thank you for all the good memories.

Now, to my brother and sister from another mother, Rajat and Shayanti, my other bestest people, thank you so much for being the most supportive friends. You guys were the ones who would never leave me alone; wherever you went, you would call me along. But I know there was one person who made our talks stop, our fun stop, but Iâ€™m glad that person isnâ€™t in your lives anymore. I hope you both stay together and never fight because of a third person. Otherwise, playing the game and being friends with you both was so much fun, and I created memories Iâ€™ll never forget. Take care of each other.

Now, itâ€™s your turn, Shivu. Donâ€™t say that youâ€™re last on my list. Let me tell you, youâ€™re not last; youâ€™re just as important as the others. They came before you, but that doesnâ€™t make them more important. You were the person I had so much fun talking to, especially when we fought and roasted each other. We couldnâ€™t stop roasting each other wherever we went. I still remember the day you first met me in the game. You were being sweet at first, but later started roasting me, and make me begg to be your friend. You were important to me. Thatâ€™s why I played Free Fire with you, even though I didnâ€™t like the game. Iâ€™m sorry, but I canâ€™t play anymore. Sharing life problems with you was also great because our lives were so similar. It felt like you were my parallel version, in a way. So yeah yeah i accepted thaat you're orginal and i am your copy in opposite gender. So, I just wanted to say that last part â€” take care, cutie. ðŸ«°

Yes, all of you were the best people to me, but for that one reason, Iâ€™m leaving everything behind. It will be hard for me to move on from the best friendship Iâ€™ve ever had with you all, and you know it hurts like hell to lose the most precious person, someone whoâ€™s more dear to me than life itself. I donâ€™t want to ruin anyoneâ€™s life because of me. Maybe Iâ€™m not enough, maybe I donâ€™t deserve friendship, maybe Iâ€™m not good at maintaining friendships. I tried, but I failed at creating a true friendship. At last i want that you all become a friends for me. And don't try to contact me on a my phone number cause i have sell my number to someone else, and i right now when you are done reading this i have deleted everything even games but i am leaving this account active but i have logout out this account too so u can text me here so whenever i came back maybe 2 year or 5 or more i will reply to your message so don't try to contact me on my number that number is using someone else
And even i am giving my bgmi id to my brother he will be playing and handling me bgmi account so bye guys i am disconnectjng from every one with 0 contact of friends but if you guys ever plan to come in my state tell me i will make best trip and your safety will be in my hand i promise 
So guys be safe and i will be safe and take care of myself even thou the war is started if you know that firing and bombing has already started in borders but I don't know whats really going to happen and you know that i live near border coz there is no other place we can go but we are used to this kinda of environment so just take care you all

It started with " No sorry and no thank you in friendship" and ended with " sorry for everything that i did" and Thank you for everything that you did"
Can we strangers again?
